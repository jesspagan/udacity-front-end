Your response goes here!

* I learned about tags that are deprecated and the new versions of those.
* The lessons have been a reflesher of things I already new, so mostly everything.
* Since the Text Editor can render the HTML on the fly while editing, switching 
  to browser was an extra step that I felt I want to avoid.
* All the documentation has been very useful.
