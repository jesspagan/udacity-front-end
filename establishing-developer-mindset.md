Hi Jess!

I hope that by now you have learned so many new things about creating amazing 
web design and new technology about developing them. I'm really sure that by now 
you had encountered a lot of obstacles and got stuck multiples times. Maybe you 
are stuck right now!! So, if you're lost and got into a point that you are not 
really sure what to do, I want you to remember some little things.

First, try to really understand what is the problem. As for now, you may 
noticed that you don't have the help of a compiler to really show you in which 
line the program is breaking. That means that you have to understand which 
element is broken, what things are connected to that element and how they 
influence in it. You always say that if you can explain programming things to 
children, then you really understand how it works. So try not to rush into things.

You always had the reputation as the know-it-all, but that doesn't mean that 
you can't ask about things. That will not make you less than anyone else. You 
know that we all have to start somewhere, and there's always a community that 
will be willing to help you to get through things. Maybe after finished this 
nanodegree, you will be the one giving back by helping others go through 
problems where you were before.

And, to finish, READ THE F* DOCUMENTATION!! Lol, that's something that they 
tough us from the beginning of college and sometimes we always forget. This goes 
with trying not to rush into things and really understand what you are doing. 
Its not a race, is a learning experience. Enjoy the journey.

GOAL Statement:

I see web development as a creative programming field. Where you have the 
opportunity to create elegant, easy-to-use, beautiful programming projects. 
It not only makes you a better problem-solver, but also a very open-mind person. 
I really love designing and I'm very detailed oriented with everything. I think 
that this is a very dynamic field and when I graduate I would really like to 
be prepare to apply for a role like this one.


Questions:
I always looking and reading job post for Front-End developers and I noticed 
that they sometimes asked you about having a portfolio with projects. I see 
udacity as a great resource for that, but I think I could have some more. 

I want to really understand what they are looking for in a portfolio.
What things a recruiter is looking for in a interview for a front-end developer?
What things you can expect to do in a technical interview for a front-end developer?
What things, beside completed this nanodegree, could help me be a better candidate?
